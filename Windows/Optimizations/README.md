Think of these scripts like either "PC Gamer Optimizations" that **ARE NOT MEANT FOR PRODUCTION USE** or even **EXPERIMENTAL** tasks/actions meant to be ran in a sandbox that **COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA.**

If you do **your** best to ensure you **read everything**, I will do **my** best to ensure I **document everything**.
