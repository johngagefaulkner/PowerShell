Files in this folder are mostly resources like JSON to be parsed by a script/app or any other data that needs to be centralized.

## Index

- **[Control Panel Items:](ControlPanelItems.json)** JSON array of Friendly and Canonical Names for all Control Panel Items available in (up-to) Windows 11 Pro.
- **[Get-DeviceLastBootUpTime.ps1](DeviceLastBootupTime.ps1)**: This PowerShell script has been carefully written and rewritten many times over with the help of multiple GitHub users to ensure it properly accounts for whether Fast Startup is enabled on the device where the script is running.
